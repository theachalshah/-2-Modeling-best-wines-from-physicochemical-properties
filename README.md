#2 Modeling best wines from physicochemical properties

Model â€“ k-Nearest Neighbors Classification.

Learnt about curse of dimensionality. In KNN as the dimensions increases, the average distance between points increases. But what's more problematic is the ratio between the closest distance and the average distance.

Evaluation â€“ To choose best wines, used data with quality>5(0-10) to filter out outliers and features parameters with p-value < 0.001 which signifies strong correlation as input variables may or may not be relevant. The classes are ordered and not balanced.
